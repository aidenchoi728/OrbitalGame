Num,Type,Module/Checkpoint Num,Name,Description,Alignment
1,Module,1,Waves,"What are 3D waves? Find out about waves, in 1D, 2D, and 3D.",
2,Module,2,The Orbital,Find out about how electrons exist as waves in the modern atomic model. See various orbitals in the hydrogen atom using the boundary representation.,"Playground | 3D Orbital Explorer, 2D Orbital Explorer, Compare Orbitals"
3,Module,3,The Phases,"Find out about the two phases in an orbital. Along the way, learn about the wave function, Ψ.",
4,Module,4,Radial Nodes,"What happens when Ψ is zero? Find out about nodes, specifically radial nodes. Along the way, learn about Ψ² and the principal quantum number.",
5,Checkpoint,1,How Many Radial Nodes?,,
